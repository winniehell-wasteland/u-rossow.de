**mainly involved in**  
characterization and growth of semiconductor layers and nanostructures  
optical response of surfaces

**specialized in optical characterization with**  
polarization sensitive methods spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE)  
reflectance difference spectroscopy (RDS, RAS)

**also worked with other classical surface spectroscopies such as**  
photoemission (XPS)  
Auger electron spectroscopy (AES)
