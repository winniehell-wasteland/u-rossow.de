<p>
    Currently, I am working as a senior scientist
    <small>(Akademischer Rat)</small>
    at TU Braunschweig.
    I am mainly involved in the characterization and growth of semiconductor layers and nanostructures
    and the optical response of surfaces. My speciality is the optical characterization with the polarization
    sensitive methods spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) and reflectance difference spectroscopy (RDS, RAS). I also
    worked with other classical surface spectroscopies such as photoemission (XPS) or
    Auger electron spectroscopy (AES).
